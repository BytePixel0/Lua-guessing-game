# Lua-guessing-game
This is a beginner-friendly mini project written in Lua - a classic "Number guessing game" with a twist.

Features:-
1.) Guessing number is randomly choosen begween 1 to 100.
2.) Guess limit.
3.) Feedback on guess proximity. (Too high, Too low, etc.)
4.) Tracks guess history.

NOTE:- This is the updated version of the Mini Project 2 (Guessing Game).
Changes:- 1.) Added user input support (No more hardcoded guesses).
          2.) Changed random number range from 1-20 to 1-100.
          3.) Improved replayability.

How It Works:-
The player gets 5 chances to guess the correct number.
Feedback is provided after each guess.
At the end, a guess history is shown.

Why I Built This:-
Part of my journey to learn "Lua" from scratch.
This was my second "Mini project" after learning variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and tables. 

Tools used:-
Lua (in Codea app for ipad)
