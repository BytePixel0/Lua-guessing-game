# Lua-guessing-game
This is a beginner-friendly mini project written in Lua - a classic "Number guessing game" with a twist.

Features:-
1.) Guessing number is randomly choosen begween 1 to 20.
2.) Guess limit.
3.)Feedback on guess proximity. (Too high, Too low, etc.)
4.)Tracks guess history.

How It Works:-
The player gets 5 chances to guess the correct number. (due to user input not available on ipad, i hardcoded these guesses).
Feedback is provided after each guess.
At the end, a guess history is shown.

Why I Built This:-
Part of my journey to learn "Lua" from scratch.
This was my second "Mini project" after learning variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and tables.

Tools used:-
Lua (in Codea app for ipad)
